*Far above your head, above the clouds in the boundless sky lie the Luminiferous Uplands.
A timeless land of eternal spring filled with strange and wonderful creatures; the last natural remnant
of a past long forgotten. There are no oceans, only endless voids between the massive
floating mountains held up only by faith and their own solid cores. The cold
stone of the mountaintops remains the only earthly reminder of that ancient dimension.*
